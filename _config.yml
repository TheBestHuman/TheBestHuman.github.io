          An app written in Node.js/Javascript that converts an image into plans to recreate that image with [Perler beads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuse_beads)
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Perler/fuse beads are the perfect Saturday afternoon activity. I was first introduced to them a few years ago and was disappointed with the limited choice of patterns available. I built this as a hobby project to convert arbitrary images into Perler bead patterns.
          This project runs <mark>Node.js</mark> in <mark>Docker</mark> containers with <mark>Javascript</mark> for the UI. It pixelates the image, quantizes the colors, and reconstructs the image in mosaic form, with a helpful legend/shopping list of beads required to reconstruct the image.

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
